- 👋 Hi, I’m @SilviaBG
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to Data Analysis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Power BI, SQL and Python. I'm already expert in Excel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analisys projects that could help me to develop my hard skills on this field.
- I am open to any suggestion you have, or any help with. I am really new to this world, everything will help me and I will apreciate it very much!!
